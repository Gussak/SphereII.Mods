In the fight against the degredation of society, SyX Security has produced a series of counter-\/measures against the so-\/called \char`\"{}zombie apocalypse\char`\"{}. Deployed in infected hotspots around the world, these counter-\/measures have been designed to reduce and ultimately send the zombie apocalypse into remission.

Warning\+: These hot spots are extremely dangerous for the non-\/infected, and any survivors are strongly recommended to be evacuated before they are deployed.
