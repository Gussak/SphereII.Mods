The follow SDX Mods are more of "Core" mods that add new abilities and features for modders to use. It's recommended that they be used together.  A large amount of code and features were added to these to allow modders flexibility.

These are community mods: You may contribute code and fixes, and freely re-use them. 

[i]These do not represent a complete play through or experience. They are meant to be consumed by modders into their mods and balanced.[/i]

Combined, they can be used to create a more realistic world with NPCs, allowing you to hire each entity using different currencies. You can also be rewarded NPCs based on certain quest chains. Some NPCs can even follow you if you are holding a special block or item in your hand.

Once hired, you can ask the NPC to perform various duties, such as following you, helping you loot a poi, patrol a section of your base, or just stay still. 

Don't think you can allow yourself unlimited NPCs. These NPCs have a Maslow AI task, which makes them hungry and thirsty. Be sure to have food and drink nearby so they can drink and eat when they need it. 

A small extension to the EntityAliveSDX is the Farming animal mod, Bloom's Family Animal Husbandry. Find and tame animals herds, or get rewarded through quests lines. Same rules apply as the NPCs, you need to make sure you have food and water near by. Same Cows, sheep, chickens and pigs are packaged inside of them.

NPCs and Animals's life cycles can be control through buff sequences, allowing the animals to grow from babies to seniors, eventually dying of old age. 

A tremendous amount of thanks to Xyth and Khaine for their tireless testing, entity creation and feature ideas.
