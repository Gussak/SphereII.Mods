SyX Security Bots
=================

In the fight against the degradation of society, SyX Security has produced a series of counter-measures against the so-called "zombie apocalypse". Deployed in infected hot spots around the world, these counter-measures have been designed to reduce and ultimately send the zombie apocalypse into remission. 

Warning: These hot spots are extremely dangerous for the non-infected, and any survivors are strongly recommended to be evacuated before they are deployed.
